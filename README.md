Helix is a personal Assistant made for Linux/GNU. He supports a wide range of commands and functions, optional you can also
add an WolframAlpha API and OpenAI API for more features. 

## Installation

Run the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then start Helix with Python:
```bash
pyhton3 Helix.py
```
From now on you can then start Helix with "pyhton3 Helix.py", but remember that you always have to navigate to the Helix
folder to start Helix.

## Good to know

Helix is also capable of understanding everyday conversation, making it versatile in its interactions.
Make sure that you don't include any of the above commands in your ever day command, because then
the function for this specific command will be called.

You have the option to activate or deactivate OpenAI and WolframAlpha, but then WolframAlpa and OpenAI
commands are not available anymore and Helix will not be capable of handling all every day commands. As well
as that the the responses of everday commands are not that good anymore.

You have also the option to change the location for the weather information as well as the APIs for the AIs. To
do this please enter the command for it.
