Helix is also capable of understanding everyday conversation, making it versatile in its interactions.
Make sure that you don't include any of the above commands in your ever day command, because then
the function for this specific command will be called.
You have the option to activate or deactivate OpenAI and WolframAlpha, but then WolframAlpa and OpenAI
commands are not available anymore and Helix will not be capable of handling all every day commands. As well
as that the the responses of everday commands are not that good anymore.
You have also the option to change the location for the weather information as well as the APIs for the AIs. To
do this please enter the command for it.
